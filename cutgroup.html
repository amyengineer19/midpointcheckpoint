            seeks to help residents take an active part in their government systems.
            This hands-on approach to to user testing ensures that government websites and apps are functional and in
            tune to their residents' needs.  CUTgroup helps faciliate civic engagement through user testing of civic tech
            tools.  We believe that civic tech tools should be an easy, inuitive experience, and one way to make that
            happen is to offer citizens a way to voice their opinion in how these tools should function.
