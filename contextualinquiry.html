                <a href="https://amyeng.myportfolio.com/case-study-client-recruitment">The Problem</a>- the client expressed
                frustration with their current database management system and their overall process for customer
                recruitment and matching, a yearly process that is a large portion of their work.  After meeting
                with the client to understand the organization and their goals for this project, we wereready to start
                conducting interviews with the three different stakeholder groups.

                Contextual Inquiry- prepping the interview questions well in advance proved useful and I improved my
                inquiry skills with each iteration.  As I drilled down to understand what exactly is not functional about
                their recruitment and matching methods, their communication with their customers, and Airtable, I was
                able to collect a lot of qualitative data.

            <p>I sorted through the data by creating groupings of similiar findings.  This is called affinity mapping</p>

                Affinity Wall- these translate to recommendations for how their new platform, Salesforce, should function.

                Productive Client Solutions- the process was very informative and led to several implications.
                Every finding was attached to a recommendation.  I strived to ensure that every recommendation included
                actionable steps, with a timeline and the intended improved outcomes.

                For example, it became apparent that their process of recruiting, scoping, and matching customers
                to the right program is a lengthy process that has several points of improvement.  Check out what
                I presented to the clients below!

                It was very important that the organization start training their employees to work with all of the clients well in advance.

                Communicating with their clients often enough to keep them in the loop is an essential part of ensuring that clients have
                a good matching experience.

                The organization has decided to switch their client database to the Salesforce platform.  They should work directly with
                the Salesforce service representatives to ensure that they are making the most of the platform.  They should also make sure
                that the things they like and don't like about Airtable is properly translated to the new platform.
